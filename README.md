How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

The best way to interpret user needs and implement them is by creating and maintaining a well-groomed product backlog. The product backlog is made up of "user stories", which are individual elements of functionality that are requested by users and stakeholders. A user will submit a specific feature or functionality that they want to be present in the program. It is then our job to distill the user's wish into a concise "user story" with acceptance criteria and clear pass/fail parameters for testing. Part of maintaining the product backlog is prioritizing the user stories in terms of value added to a program, as well as accurately estimate the amount of time and effort each item may take so that we can determine what features we can realistically accomplish during a sprint.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I hope to incorporate the agile methodology into development by focusing on constant improvement and iteration. It is easy to get caught up in trying to implement many different features at once, which can lead to too many "moving parts" that are potentially interrelated and make the whole process more difficult in the end. It will be more effective to focus on one functionality item at once, in order of priority, to create a viable product that functions as expected after each iteration. This allows us to go back and add or change functionality while still maintaining a working product, which leads to a better finished product in the end.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member is first and foremost an effective communicator. They need to be willing and able to take criticism, as well as give it out when necessary. An effective communicator can make the difference between the message being taken as a way to grow and improve their skills, or with resentment and bitterness. Obviously we would also expect a good team member to have a solid foundation of the technical knowledge and skills, but this can also be overcome if they are willing to learn and accept criticism. We don't expect a new graduate or junior developer to know everything that a senior developer will, and that's okay. No one knows everything when they finish school, and a lot will be learned on the job, but only if the person is able to communicate effectively and be willing to learn.
